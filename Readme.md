# How to use reporting controls in ASP.NET Core applications


This example demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401850">Web Document Viewer</a> and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119176">Web End-User Report Designer</a> in an ASP.NET Core application.


These are the main steps to integrate these controls into an application:

1. Install the **DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting** <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a> package.

2. Install **devexpress-reporting** <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/devexpress-reporting">npm</a> package.

3. Register reporting services in the **Startup** class.

4. Reference client resources in the View file.

5. Use the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.AspNetCore.BuilderFactoryExtensions.ReportDesigner.overloads">ReportDesigner</a> and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.AspNetCore.BuilderFactoryExtensions.WebDocumentViewer.overloads">WebDocumentViewer </a> wrappers to display reporting controls on your web pages.
