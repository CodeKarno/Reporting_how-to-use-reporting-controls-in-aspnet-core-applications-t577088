# End-User Report Designer and Document Viewer in ASP.NET Core Application


This example demonstrates how to use the [End-User Report Designer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400249) and [HTML5 Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400248) in an ASP.NET Core application that targets both .NET Standard and .NET Framework.


Prior to running this example, perform the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the **package.json** file and select **Restore Packages**. This adds the node_modules folder to the application project.

2. Right-click the ASP.NET Core application and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the invoked window, switch to the **Updates** page and update the **DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting** package. You may need to add a new NuGet package source to install DevExpress packages <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T466415/devexpress-nuget-packages">online</a> or offline from the **C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 18.2\Components\System\Components\packages</strong><em> </em>path.**
